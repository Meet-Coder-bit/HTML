    <font size="5">Since the first steps were taken in the year 2015, Mishwa Ceramics has carved its niche as a consistently
        growing organisation with unparalleled innovation and passion rooted in simplicity.

        We endure gratification for every experience that we offer, created to share something truly meaningful.It may
        not resonate with the majority, but that is what takes us a class apart.If only a handful were to understand the
        purpose of our existence, we would be proud to have found our believers. Rather, people with whom we can share
        our beliefs.</font>
